/// A step-wise dendrogram that represents a hierarchical clustering as a
/// binary tree.
///
/// A dendrogram consists of a series of `N - 1` steps, where `N` is the number
/// of observations that were clustered. Each step corresponds to a merge
/// between two other clusters (where a cluster might consist of one or more
/// observations). Each step includes the labels for the pair of clusters that
/// were merged, the number of total observations in the new merged cluster
/// and the dissimilarity between the two merged clusters.
///
/// The labels of clusters are assigned as follows:
///
/// 1. A cluster that corresponds to a single observation is assigned a label
///    that corresponds to the given observation's index in the pairwise
///    dissimilarity matrix.
/// 2. A cluster with more than one observation has the label `N + i`, where
///    `N` is the total number of observations and `i` corresponds to the the
///    `i`th step in which the cluster was created. So for example, the very
///    first step in a dendrogram creates a cluster with the label `N` and the
///    last step in a dendrogram creates a cluster with the label
///    `(N + N - 1) - 1` (since there are always `N - 1` steps in a
///    dendrogram).
///
/// This labeling scheme corresponds to the same labeling scheme used by SciPy.
///
/// The type parameter `T` refers to the type of dissimilarity used in the
/// steps. In practice, `T` is a floating point type.
