This crate provides a fast implementation of agglomerative
[hierarchical clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering).

The ideas and implementation in this crate are heavily based on the work of
Daniel M端llner, and in particular, his 2011 paper,
[Modern hierarchical, agglomerative clustering algorithms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.2378.pdf).
Parts of the implementation have also been inspired by his C++
library, [`fastcluster`](http://danifold.net/fastcluster.html).
M端llner's work, in turn, is based on the hierarchical clustering facilities
provided by MATLAB and
[SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage.html).

The runtime performance of this library is on par with M端llner's `fastcluster`
implementation.

# Overview

The most important parts of this crate are as follows:

* [`linkage`](fn.linkage.html) performs hierarchical clustering on a pairwise
  dissimilarity matrix.
* [`Method`](enum.Method.html) determines the linkage criteria.
* [`Dendrogram`](struct.Dendrogram.html) is a representation of a "stepwise"
  dendrogram, which serves as the output of hierarchical clustering.

# Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```text
[dependencies]
kodama = "0.1"
```

and this to your crate root:

```
extern crate kodama;
```

# Example

Showing an example is tricky, because it's hard to motivate the use of
hierarchical clustering on small data sets, and especially hard without
domain specific details that suggest a hierarchical clustering may actually
be useful.

Instead of solving the hard problem of motivating a real use case, let's take
a look at a toy use case: a hierarchical clustering of a small number of
geographic points. We'll measure the distance (by way of the crow) between
these points using latitude/longitude coordinates with the
[Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula).

We'll use a small collection of municipalities from central Massachusetts in
our example. Here's the data:

```text
Index    Municipality    Latitude      Longitude
0        Fitchburg       42.5833333    -71.8027778
1        Framingham      42.2791667    -71.4166667
2        Marlborough     42.3458333    -71.5527778
3        Northbridge     42.1513889    -71.6500000
4        Southborough    42.3055556    -71.5250000
5        Westborough     42.2694444    -71.6166667
```

Each municipality in our data represents a single observation, and we'd like to
create a hierarchical clustering of them using [`linkage`](fn.linkage.html).
The input to `linkage` is a *condensed pairwise dissimilarity matrix*. This
matrix stores the dissimilarity between all pairs of observations. The
"condensed" aspect of it means that it only stores the upper triangle (not
including the diagonal) of the matrix. We can do this because hierarchical
clustering requires that our dissimilarities between observations are
reflexive. That is, the dissimilarity between `A` and `B` is the same as the
dissimilarity between `B` and `A`. This is certainly true in our case with the
Haversine formula.

So let's compute all of the pairwise dissimilarities and create our condensed
pairwise matrix:

```
// See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula
fn haversine((lat1, lon1): (f64, f64), (lat2, lon2): (f64, f64)) -> f64 {
    const EARTH_RADIUS: f64 = 3958.756; // miles

    let (lat1, lon1) = (lat1.to_radians(), lon1.to_radians());
    let (lat2, lon2) = (lat2.to_radians(), lon2.to_radians());

    let delta_lat = lat2 - lat1;
    let delta_lon = lon2 - lon1;
    let x =
        (delta_lat / 2.0).sin().powi(2)
        + lat1.cos() * lat2.cos() * (delta_lon / 2.0).sin().powi(2);
    2.0 * EARTH_RADIUS * x.sqrt().atan()
}

// From our data set. Each coordinate pair corresponds to a single observation.
let coordinates = vec![
    (42.5833333, -71.8027778),
    (42.2791667, -71.4166667),
    (42.3458333, -71.5527778),
    (42.1513889, -71.6500000),
    (42.3055556, -71.5250000),
    (42.2694444, -71.6166667),
];

// Build our condensed matrix by computing the dissimilarity between all
// possible coordinate pairs.
let mut condensed = vec![];
for row in 0..coordinates.len() - 1 {
    for col in row + 1..coordinates.len() {
        condensed.push(haversine(coordinates[row], coordinates[col]));
    }
}
// The length of a condensed dissimilarity matrix is always equal to
// `N-choose-2`, where `N` is the number of observations.
assert_eq!(condensed.len(), (coordinates.len() * (coordinates.len() - 1)) / 2);
```

Now that we have our condensed dissimilarity matrix, all we need to do is
choose our *linkage criterion*. The linkage criterion refers to the formula
that is used during hierarchical clustering to compute the dissimilarity
between newly formed clusters and all other clusters. This crate provides
several choices, and the choice one makes depends both on the problem you're
trying to solve and your performance requirements. For example, "single"
linkage corresponds to using the minimum dissimilarity between all pairs of
observations between two clusters as the dissimilarity between those two
clusters. It turns out that doing single linkage hierarchical clustering has
a rough isomorphism to computing the minimum spanning tree, which means the
implementation can be quite fast (`O(n^2)`, to be precise). However, other
linkage criteria require more general purpose algorithms with higher constant
factors or even worse time complexity. For example, using median linkage has
worst case `O(n^3)` complexity, although it is often `n^2` in practice.

In this case, we'll choose average linkage (which is `O(n^2)`). With that
decision made, we can finally run linkage:

```
# fn haversine((lat1, lon1): (f64, f64), (lat2, lon2): (f64, f64)) -> f64 {
#     const EARTH_RADIUS: f64 = 3958.756; // miles
#
#     let (lat1, lon1) = (lat1.to_radians(), lon1.to_radians());
#     let (lat2, lon2) = (lat2.to_radians(), lon2.to_radians());
#
#     let delta_lat = lat2 - lat1;
#     let delta_lon = lon2 - lon1;
#     let x =
#         (delta_lat / 2.0).sin().powi(2)
#         + lat1.cos() * lat2.cos() * (delta_lon / 2.0).sin().powi(2);
#     2.0 * EARTH_RADIUS * x.sqrt().atan()
# }
# let coordinates = vec![
#     (42.5833333, -71.8027778),
#     (42.2791667, -71.4166667),
#     (42.3458333, -71.5527778),
#     (42.1513889, -71.6500000),
#     (42.3055556, -71.5250000),
#     (42.2694444, -71.6166667),
# ];
# let mut condensed = vec![];
# for row in 0..coordinates.len() - 1 {
#     for col in row + 1..coordinates.len() {
#         condensed.push(haversine(coordinates[row], coordinates[col]));
#     }
# }
use kodama::{Method, linkage};

let dend = linkage(&mut condensed, coordinates.len(), Method::Average);
// The dendrogram always has `N - 1` steps, where each step corresponds to a
// newly formed cluster by merging two previous clusters. The last step creates
// a cluster that contains all observations.
assert_eq!(dend.len(), coordinates.len() - 1);
```

The output of `linkage` is a stepwise
[`Dendrogram`](struct.Dendrogram.html).
Each step corresponds to a merge between two previous clusters. Each step is
represented by a 4-tuple: a pair of cluster labels, the dissimilarity between
the two clusters that have been merged and the total number of observations
in the newly formed cluster. Here's what our dendrogram looks like:

```text
cluster1   cluster2   dissimilarity        size
2          4          3.1237967760688776   2
5          6          5.757158112027513    3
1          7          8.1392602685723      4
3          8          12.483148228609206   5
0          9          25.589444117482433   6
```

Another way to look at a dendrogram is to visualize it (the following image was
created with matplotlib):

![dendrogram of Massachusetts municipalities](http://i.imgur.com/RpFgifn.png)

If you're familiar with the central Massachusetts region, then this dendrogram
is probably incredibly boring. But if you're not, then this visualization
immediately tells you which municipalities are closest to each other. For
example, you can tell right away that Fitchburg is quite far from any other
municipality!

# Testing

The testing in this crate is made up of unit tests on internal data structures
and quickcheck properties that check the consistency between the various
clustering algorithms. That is, quickcheck is used to test that, given the
same inputs, the `mst`, `nnchain`, `generic` and `primitive` implementations
all return the same output.

There are some caveats to this testing strategy:

1. Only the `generic` and `primitive` implementations support all linkage
   criteria, which means some linkage criteria have worse test coverage.
2. Principally, this testing strategy assumes that at least one of the
   implementations is correct.
3. The various implementations do not specify how ties are handled, which
   occurs whenever the same dissimilarity value appears two or more times for
   distinct pairs of observations. That means there are multiple correct
   dendrograms depending on the input. This case is not tested, and instead,
   all input matrices are forced to contain distinct dissimilarity values.
4. The output of both M端llner's and SciPy's implementations of hierarchical
   clustering has been hand-checked with the output of this crate. It would
   be better to test this automatically, but the scaffolding has not been
   built.

Obviously, this is not ideal and there is a lot of room for improvement!
